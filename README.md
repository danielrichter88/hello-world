I'm born and raised in Cleveland.  I went to Kent State for a few years before taking time off from school.  I started up again at Tri-c to work on an associates degree  then attend Cleveland State for a bachelors and potentailly a masters.  I spend most of my time woroking at a bakery and updating my house.
